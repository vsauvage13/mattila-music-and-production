# mattila-music-and-production
The project I am proposing is the creation of a portfolio website for my brother. My brother is a musician and freelance producer living in Victoria, BC. He is looking for a website that can showcase his musical portfolio, the production services he offers, a way to contact him, and a little bit of background information.

Goals of the project include:
- Creating a responsive layout that adapts to all device sizes including mobile
- Successfully applying my knowledge of flexbox and grid to make a responsive layout
- Creating all 7 wireframe pages in HTML and CSS
- Completing the website to such a standard that the final version of the project can be provided to my brother as a potential website to use
- Learning how to use bootstrap to streamline the design process
- Make it as accessible as possible

Features I want to make: 
- Make a working contact form with radio buttons + checkboxes
- Make a working dropdown menu to navigate the website
- Have proper states for buttons including hover, used, etc

I also want to make sure that the website is visually appealing with a nice colour palette, professional images, and well-structured copy. I want to make sure the navigation is well laid out for users to easy make their way around the website. I want to try and use as simple of a framework as possible to keep the website fast and easy to load. I have never used Bootstrap before, but I think this would be a great opportunity to learn how and implement it into my work to hopefully streamline the coding process and expand my abilities.
