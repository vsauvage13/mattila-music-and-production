      <h2 class="pb-3">About Me</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Coming from a family of music lovers, it is no surprise that I have
        loved music from a very young age. I can't remember a time when I wasn't
        fiddling on the piano, banging away on the drums, trying desperately to
        figure out chords on the guitar, or performing shameless karaoke along
        with whatever song was playing. I grew up watching my father write and
        record his own songs, playing every instrument he could get his hands
        on, so I have built a very sincere appreciation of the musical
        environment and everything it has to offer.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        After relocating to Victoria, B.C., I now enjoy collaborating,
        recording, and performing music in a variety of settings. My personal
        philosophy is that music is best shared in an open and fun production
        and performance space. Ensuring my clients feel comfortable and open
        during the production and recording process is of utmost importance to
        me. I love exploring the deeper meanings of music alongside appreciating
        its most delicate simplicities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-3">Education</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        After completing my Music Performance Diploma with Camosun College in
        (*what year was he awarded his diploma?*), I am continuing my education
        at the University of Victoria studying Music Technology and Business
        (*What program is he taking?*) in hopes to further share my passion for
        music and everything it offers with everyone I can.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        In my musical endeavours, I have had the pleasure of performing at the
        Victoria Conservatory of Music and in multiple pubs and cafés across
        Vancouver Island. While recording and producing several personal
        projects in various studios and public spaces around the city, I
        realized that every room, pub, stage, and café has something uniquely
        magical to offer. Music has the profound ability to bring people
        together and bonds the producer, performer, and audience as one.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pb-3">Styles & Motivation</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I enjoy combining music's traditional styles, like classical, jazz, and
        R&B, with the unique styles and experiences my clients bring. This
        creates an authentic atmosphere for the artist that helps them stand out
        while remaining true to the integrity of their music's foundations. I
        personally love to mix the stories heard in blues and gospel with the
        modern sounds of rock, folk, and electronic.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        My passion for music and the unique sense of satisfaction that comes
        with bringing others joy has led me to where I am today. Providing every
        single one of my clients with a truly customizable and unique experience
        tailored specifically for them is an extremely rewarding and fulfilling
        experience.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I can't wait to work with you and create something truly magical.
